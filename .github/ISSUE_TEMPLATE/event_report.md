# _Assignees_
###### <small>Since our private repository paid plan is free, we cannot use the full GitHub team functionality (such as adding multiple Assignees to an issue). After evaluation, we have decided not to upgrade our paid plan. We added a module 'Assignees' to the Issue Template to specify all Assignees.</small>
